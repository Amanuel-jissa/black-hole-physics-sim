# black-hole-physics-sim
A python the lensing effect of a black hole on an image. This project provides a basic demonstration of gravitational lensing using image warping techniques with OpenCV and Matplotlib. Note that this is a simplified visual effect and does not represent a physically accurate simulation of light bending around a black hole.
